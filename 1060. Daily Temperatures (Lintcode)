# Given a list of daily temperatures, produce a list that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

# For example, given the list temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

# Example
# Example 1:
# 	Input:  temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
# 	Output:  [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
	
# 	Explanation:
# 	Just find the first day after it which has higher temperatures than it.

	
# Example 2:
# 	Input: temperatures = [50, 40, 39, 30]
# 	Output:  [0,0,0,0]
