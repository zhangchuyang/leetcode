# Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

# String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

# Find the letter that was added in t.

# Example:

# Input:
# s = "abcd"
# t = "abcde"

# Output:
# e

# Explanation:
# 'e' is the letter that was added
