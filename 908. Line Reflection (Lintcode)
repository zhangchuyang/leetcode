# Given n points on a 2D plane, find if there is such a line parallel to y-axis that reflect the given points.

# Example
# Example1

# Input: [[1,1],[-1,1]]
# Output: true
# Example2

# Input: [[1,1],[-1,-1]]
# Output: false
# Challenge
# Could you do better than O(n2)?


# Find the min and max among with the points and check if the line is always correct
