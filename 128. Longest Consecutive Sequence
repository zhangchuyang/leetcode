# Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

# Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

# Example:

# Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.


# use Set
