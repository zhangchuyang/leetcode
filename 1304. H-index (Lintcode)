# Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

# According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

# Example
# Example1

# Input: citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# The researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
# Example2

# Input: citations = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
# Output: 5
# Explanation:
# The researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 5 papers with at least 5 citations, his h-index is 5.
# Notice
# If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
