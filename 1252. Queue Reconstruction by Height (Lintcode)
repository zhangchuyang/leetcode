# Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

# Example
# Example1

# Input:
# [[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]
# Output:
# [[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
# Example2

# Input:
# [[2,0],[1,1]]
# Output:
# [[2,0],[1,1]]
# Notice
# The number of people is less than 1,100.
