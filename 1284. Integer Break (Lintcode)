# Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

# Example
# Example1

# Input: 2
# Output: 1
# Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1
# Example2

# Input: 10
# Output: 36
# Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4
# Notice
# You may assume that n is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.
