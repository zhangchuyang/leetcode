# All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

# Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

# Example
# Example1

# Input: "A"
# Output: []
# Example2

# Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
# Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]

class Solution:
    """
    @param s: a string
    @return: return List[str]
    """
    def findRepeatedDnaSequences(self, s):
        # write your code here
