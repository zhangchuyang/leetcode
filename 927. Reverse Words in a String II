# Given an input character array, reverse the array word by word. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.

# The input character array does not contain leading or trailing spaces and the words are always separated by a single space.

# Example
# Example1

# Input: s = "the sky is blue"
# Output: "blue is sky the"
# Example2

# Input: "a b c"
# Output: "c b a"
# Challenge
# Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?
