# In a array A of size 2N, there are N+1 unique elements, and exactly one of these elements is repeated N times.

# Return the element repeated N times.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: [1,2,3,3]
# Output: 3
# Example 2:

# Input: [2,1,2,5,3,2]
# Output: 2
# Example 3:

# Input: [5,1,5,2,5,3,5,4]
# Output: 5
