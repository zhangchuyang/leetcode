# Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "Hour:Minutes" format, find the minimum minutes difference between any two time points in the list.

# Example
# Example 1:

# Input:
# ["23:59","00:00"]
# Output:
# 1
# Example 2:

# Input:
# ["01:01","02:01"]
# Output:
# 60
# Notice
# 1.The number of time points in the given list is at least 2 and won't exceed 20000.
# 2.The input time is legal and ranges from 00:00 to 23:59
